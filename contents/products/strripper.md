StrRipper allows you to download videos from sites like Youtube and view them locally without reconnecting to the site. This can save precious bandwidth for companies who want to use videos for training, or just be used for saving your favourite videos in one place.

StrRipper makes use of a very powerful permission system, allowing companies who need tight security to implement this but keeping it simple enough that users who don't need to use it can forget about it.

StrRipper is useful for anybody who needs access to the same video more than once, but doesn't like the idea of redownloading it every time they want to watch it.
