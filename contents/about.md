## The Company

DNH Computing is a company dedicated to providing quality websites, software and classes in PHP. Founded in mid-2007, we strive to create innovative and useful tools for the internet.

## The Products

We have 2 main types of products.

## Open Source

These products and classes are free to the community, released under the LGPL license.

## Commercial

These products we charge a small fee for a license to use them for the first 3 years only. After that they are released to the community in the same way our open source software is.

We also provide quality support for our software for a reasonable price.

## The People

DNH Computing consists of two people:

* Daniel Hodder
* Nicholas Hinds

We are the sole coders for this company at this point in time.

The acronym DNH actually stands for Daniel Nicholas Hodder/Hinds, with the two H's compacted into one.
